## Implementation of Multiplexing/Demultiplexing
This is a Computer Network omnetp+ project.
Multiplexing and demultiplexing techniques play a vital role in achieving this by combining multiple data streams into a single channel for transmission and separating them at the receiving end. This project proposes the development of a simulation environment to demonstrate the practical implementation of these functionalities.
